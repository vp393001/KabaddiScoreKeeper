Game Chosen

The chosen game has either multiple amounts of points that can be scored, as in american football, or multiple important metrics to track, such as fouls, outs, and innings in baseball.

Overall layout

Column contents

Each column contains a large TextView to keep track of the current score for that team.

Optionally, a second TextView to track another important metric such as fouls can be added.

Score buttons

Each column contains multiple buttons. The buttons must track either:

Each track a different kind of scoring

Or

Each track a different metric (one score, the other fouls, for instance).

Reset button

The layout contains a ‘reset’ button.
